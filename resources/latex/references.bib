@article{Gotzner-et-al:2020,
	abstract = {{Children's difficulty deriving scalar implicatures has been attributed to a variety of factors including processing limitations, an inability to access scalar alternatives, and pragmatic tolerance. The present research explores the nature of children's difficulty by investigating a previously unexplored kind of inference---an exhaustivity implicature that is triggered by disjunction. We reasoned that if children are able to draw quantity implicatures but have difficulties accessing alternative lexical expressions from a scale, then they should perform better on exhaustivity implicatures than on scalar implicatures, since the former do not require spontaneously accessing relevant scalar alternatives from the lexicon. We conducted two experiments. Experiment 1 found that 4- to 5-year-olds consistently computed exhaustivity implicatures to a greater extent than scalar implicatures. Experiment 2 demonstrated that children are more likely to compute exhaustivity implicatures with disjunction compared to conjunction. We conclude that children often fail to derive scalar implicatures because (1) they struggle to access scalar alternatives and (2) disjunction (but not conjunction) makes subdomain alternatives particularly salient. Thus, the findings suggest that exhaustivity implicatures can be derived without reference to a scale of alternatives.}},

	abstract = {{In this paper I discuss how to account for the performative effects of imperatives, and concentrate mainly on permission sentences. In the first part of the paper I argue that the performative effects of permission sentences should be accounted for in terms of a context change theory by making use of contraction defined in terms of an ordering relation, and show also how this ordering relation evolves from permission to permission. In the second part a problem for this analysis is discussed, i. e. the problem of conjunctive permission sentences. I develop two ways to solve this problem. First, I suggest that this problem is due to the wrong way of accounting for contraction, and propose an alternative way in which contraction can be defined that accounts for the performative effects of conjunctive permissions in a more satisfactory way. Although the analysis is appealing, I will argue that we should account for the problem by means of a type-shift analysis.}},
