  "<h1>Instructions</h1><p>This experiment is about reasoning. You will be presented with sentences on the screen. After one or more sentences are presented, we will ask you <strong>whether you can draw a certain conclusion from them</strong>. We want to know whether, assuming that the sentences you are given are true, <strong>you think</strong> that the proposed conclusion is <strong>guaranteed to be true</strong>. You may take as much time as you want on each question, but please do not make any notes or diagrams as you decide on your answer.</p><p>We will now give you <strong>two examples</strong> of the kinds of questions you will be asked.</p>");

(Because, when the sentence in <strong>boldface</strong> is assumed to be true, the conclusion has to be true as well.)</p><p>Click below for another example.</p>");

  "<h2>Example 2</h2><p><strong>Dana has two kids.</strong></p><p><i>Question:</i></p><p>Does it follow that <i>Dana has a son and a daughter</i>?</p><p><i>Answer:</i></p><p>No. (Because the sentence in <strong>boldface</strong> could be true and the conclusion false. Dana could have two boys or two girls.)</p><p>That's all the examples we have for you. Click below to begin the experiment.</p>");
